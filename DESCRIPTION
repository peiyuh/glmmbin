Description: This package is to use GLMM model (including estimation and bootstrap to analyze the data. In the package, we use ctsib.csv as an example and with our package, the goal of the analysis is to determine how the surface and vision treatments affect a personâ€™s stability. We also set the hypothesis test to help us to test the significance of each predictor. You could see all the examples and plots through the vignette to better understand how the package would work with GLMM.
